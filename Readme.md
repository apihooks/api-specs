Apihooks is a collection of commonly required apis to build a web or mobile app connected with webhooks; these apis remove the pain of developing managing parts of your app that is not your core competency.

This repo contains Swagger specs for various Apihooks apis. Currently specs in this repo and the apis themselves are in alpha version, i.e. in development and constant flux. Please DO NOT use these in production.

## Apis

   * [General](https://github.com/apihooks/apis/blob/master/general.yaml) - this defines the general principles for the apis.
   * [Abuse](https://github.com/apihooks/apis/blob/master/abuse.yaml) - this is spec for abuse api.

## Spec

The apis are documented using [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). All apis provided by Apihooks will have a corresponding Swagger spec in this repo.

## SDKs

  TODO: auto generate client SDK using Swagger as part of releases.
